Goal: Create a boxing app that allows users to track their progress.
Load HIT workouts and it can track timers and + what ur supposed to be doing and then track punches + power + speed
and then visual and maybe audio indicators for the workout - when to pause and rotate.


Progression of Dev:

Step 1: ✅ Create a camera that can track punches and power + speed
Step 2: ✅ Fix and shows % of power in a punch and what % of it is compared to other punches
Step 3: Optimize so the camera can track from a few angles (different side views)
Step 4: ✅ Create a workout timer + Make it match 30 Minute HIT workout
Step 5: Add Pausing and stuff
Step 6: Add a way to save progress
Step 7: Progress Dashboard
Step 8: Workout Analytics
Step 9: Rocky type UI lol

Extra for later:
1. Listens if you say pause and it can for you (HandsFree)
2. Adding AI to give feedback and tips
